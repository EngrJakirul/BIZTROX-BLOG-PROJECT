(1, 1, 1, 'World Wildlife Day: Conversations with conservationists', 'Bangladesh still boasts pockets of biodiverse hotspots, but how can we protect them?', '<p>Located at the tip of the largest bay in the world, Bangladesh is \r\ncrammed with a rapidly increasing human population. That, coupled with \r\nthe nation\'s economic growth, means a huge clamour for dwindling \r\nresources, investments on highways, infrastructure, power lines and \r\nfactories. While I do not believe that a growing population is the root \r\nof all evil, in a cramped landmass such as ours, it can take a heavy \r\ntoll on resources, unless policymakers have the vision of a sustainable \r\nfuture.</p>\r\n<p>Owing to its unique location in the Indo-Himalayan realm, the country\r\n boasts immense biodiversity in its varied landscapes. According to the \r\nlatest available data as per International Union for Conservation of \r\nNature (IUCN), Bangladesh has a total of 1,619 species that includes 138\r\n mammals, 566 birds, 167 reptiles, 49 amphibians, 253 freshwater fishes,\r\n 141 crustaceans and 305 species of butterflies. A vast majority of \r\ninvertebrates, estuarine and marine fishes had to be left out of the \r\nsurvey.</p>\r\n<p>If we look at it from the perspective of all the world\'s species, \r\nBangladesh supports nearly 1.7 percent of the world\'s wildlife. How is \r\nthat wildlife doing? Why does the chirping of birds no longer wake us up\r\n every morning? When was the last time a frog just showed up in our \r\nbathrooms?</p><p></p>', '<p>Bangladesh has gone through at least two major geopolitical changes \r\nin the last century, and by the time we became an independent nation in \r\n1971, we had already lost some of our most charismatic megafauna. \r\nAccording to Dr Reza Khan, the populations of many of our surviving \r\nmegafauna – such as the gigantic Bryde\'s whales, Asian elephants, Bengal\r\n tigers, dolphins, clouded leopards, binturong, hornbills and gharials –\r\n are also dwindling. These species might disappear from our territory in\r\n 20-50 years.</p>\r\n<p>So, what is the next step for Bangladesh, a country extremely rich in\r\n biodiversity, which also happens to be the ground zero of an impending \r\nclimate crisis?</p>\r\n<p>I caught up with some young conservationists working in the country\'s\r\n wild spaces to try and understand the challenges towards wildlife \r\nconservation in Bangladesh, and the way forward.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is habitat loss one of our primary concerns?</strong>\r\n</p><p>The Covid pandemic was a stark reminder of how closely connected \r\nwe are with wildlife. Viruses such as Sars-Cov-2 frequently jumps to \r\nhumans from wild animals. As the onslaught of development continues, our\r\n last remaining wild spaces are shrinking, increasing the chances of \r\nhuman-wildlife conflict.</p>\r\n<p>\"Habitat loss is one of the biggest challenges for Bangladesh. To \r\naddress that, we need proper management. But ensuring that is another \r\nbig hurdle. On paper, we have many protected areas, but we have to widen\r\n and strengthen the net of protection. Even though we are such a \r\nbiodiverse nation, the status of our wildlife in one word is \'poor,\'\" \r\nsays Sayam U Chowdhury, who primarily focuses on migratory shorebirds of\r\n the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, and on developing tools to manage \r\ncoastal habitats and identifying mitigation measures in response to \r\nclimate change.</p>\r\n<p>Almost all the conservationists I spoke to echo the same sentiments. \r\nThe government last year handed over a part of Jungle Khuniya Palong \r\nreserved forest in Cox\'s Bazar to the Bangladesh Football Federation \r\n(BFF) for building a residential training facility after de-reserving \r\nthe 20-acre land.</p>\r\n<p>Shahriar Caeser Rahman, whose work focuses on community-based \r\nconservation, especially in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), lamented \r\nthis de-reserving of forests. \"I believe the biggest challenge for \r\nBangladesh\'s wildlife conservation is managing our protected areas. A \r\nlot of the reserved forests are being de-reserved and allocated by the \r\ngovernment to other bodies. Even the football federation was allocated a\r\n part of the reserved forest to make a training centre. And many parts \r\nof where I work – the forests in the hill tracts – have been declared as\r\n union parishads, which means more development activities, settlement of\r\n human population and driving out the last of the wildlife that remains \r\nthere.\"</p>\r\n<p>The science and practice of wildlife conservation is still relatively\r\n new in Bangladesh, which means there is a lack of political will at the\r\n top level along with a failure to engage communities where \r\ninterventions are needed.</p>\r\n<p>For Alifa Bintha Haque, who works with marine and coastal fishers to \r\nprotect sharks and rays, the biggest challenge towards conservation of \r\nmarine species is a little different from others.</p>\r\n<p>\"We have a huge community of coastal and marine fishers in \r\nBangladesh, and most of them have very little access to information or \r\nfinancial capacity to really understand bycatch mitigation. We need \r\nlegal infrastructure and technical innovation to minimise interaction \r\nwith sharks and rays.</p>\r\n<p>\"As a nation, we need to strive for a society based on equality, and \r\nnot marginalise one group for the agenda of others. That I think is the \r\nbiggest challenge for a country in Global South: finding conservation \r\nsolutions that work both for the community and the species,\" says Alifa.</p><p></p>', 'blog-images/blog-image167782608465209730380474.jpg', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-03-03 00:48:04', '2023-03-03 00:48:04'),

This has raised concerns about the security of visitors,\r\n especially at night. On October 22, a marine engineer named Shahadat \r\nHossain Majumder was reportedly killed by muggers in the lake area.</p><p>Clearly, the DSCC needs to do a much better job of protecting this \r\nlake at the heart of the capital. It must start by reviewing its \r\ndecision to lease out parts of the lake or allow so many commercial \r\nestablishments there, even though the law prohibits leasing or \r\ntransforming of such open spaces and lakes. We cannot help but wonder, \r\nwhy would the authorities still do that? Why would they allow distorting\r\n the original lake plan? Unfortunately, not only Dhanmondi Lake, the \r\nDSCC has leased several other such spaces as well. For example, at the \r\nBahadur Shah Park in Old Dhaka, leasing made way for invasive food \r\nstalls.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, green, open spaces where residents can go for clear air and \r\nrelaxation are fast disappearing from our city. The authorities, \r\nespecially the city corporations, must take steps to check this \r\ndangerous trend. They must terminate lease contracts that violate the \r\nlaw or at least ensure those are followed properly.</p>', 'blog-images/blog-image167783274437454861676129.jpg', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-03-03 02:39:04', '2023-03-03 02:39:04'),

For \r\nexample, recent years saw the trend of traffic police using laser lights\r\n in various intersections of the city. If these lights come into contact\r\n with one\'s eyes, one can be unable to see properly for minutes. Experts\r\n say, exposure to such lights can lead to cataracts and even blindness. \r\nAnd when they fall on the eyes of drivers, it increases the possibility \r\nof accidents, as <a href=\"https://bangla.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news-455531\">a report by this daily </a>suggests. <br></p>', '<p>Even the traffic sergeants at various points in Dhaka have admitted that\r\n using such lights is harmful, but they still use it because they have \r\nto control traffic from afar at times, and raising their voices does not\r\n help amid all the commotion around. However, this is no excuse for \r\nusing such a harmful method. The law enforcement which should be \r\ndeterring the use of such lights by the public cannot be using them \r\nthemselves. This means that existing means of enforcement are not \r\nworking or that we do not know how to use them. Reportedly, the traffic \r\ndepartment is discouraging the use of these lights, to little effect so \r\nfar. They also say that they confiscate the lights when they come across\r\n them and forbid their staff to use them.We must ask, whose idea was it in the first place to use these laser \r\nlights? Why have we taken such a rudimentary approach to traffic control\r\n when the country is dreaming to be a Smart Bangladesh? We must look for\r\n modern ways of managing traffic that are also practical. If not \r\ngrounded in reality, even solutions like the modern-sounding AI-driven \r\ntraffic control system will fail, according to experts. For that to \r\nwork, we must first establish discipline on our roads. Currently, poor \r\ntraffic management, haphazard construction, and the presence of so many \r\nvehicles of so varying speeds are the root causes of heavy traffic, \r\nwhile poor road conditions, a chaotic public transport system, \r\njaywalking, etc. are also contributing to it. To make traffic lights \r\neffective, we need an integrated strategy, and collaboration among all \r\nkey parties is essential.Another key reason for traffic congestion is lax enforcement of existing\r\n traffic laws. High-profile offenders are often spared, bribes instead \r\nof punishment are a regular practice, and arbitrary application of \r\ntraffic laws is commonplace. At a time when even our neighbouring \r\ncountries – with problems similar to ours such as overpopulation and \r\ncorruption – have been able to maintain some semblance of discipline in \r\ntheir traffic system, we are still lagging far behind in this respect. \r\nIt is high time our authorities took the matter seriously and came up \r\nwith a comprehensive strategy to alleviate the traffic situation in our \r\nmajor cities, without resorting to harmful practices such as using laser\r\n lights.</p>', 'blog-images/blog-image167783295537743114265938.jpg', 0, 0, 0, 1, '2023-03-03 02:42:35', '2023-03-03 02:42:35'),

The police \r\ntried to justify their baton charges on the BNP activists by saying that\r\n they did so to clear the roads or that they were attacked first by the \r\nBNP activists; the BNP leaders and activists, on the other hand, claimed\r\n that their protest marches were largely peaceful and that the Awami \r\nLeague activists and the police attacked them without any provocation. \r\nThe general secretary of Natore city unit BNP also claimed that the \r\n\"Jubo League and Chhatra League men hurled the bombs from motorcycles\" \r\nto scare them.</p><p>Around two weeks earlier, we witnessed similar incidents of violence in \r\nwhich at least 200 people, mostly BNP activists, were injured. While the\r\n BNP\'s programme was pre-scheduled – a march in every union parishad to \r\npress home its 10-point demand, including the next national election \r\nunder a caretaker government – the Awami League also held \"peace \r\nrallies\" at the union level on the same day.

Because of these positions\' freedom and \r\nconvenience, they are a feasible choice for many people who want to \r\nimprove their work-life balance, reduce their commute time, or simply \r\nwork in a comfortable and familiar setting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Not all work-at-home opportunities are made alike. Discover what may \r\nbe a suitable match for you. The COVID-19 pandemic brought about \r\nsignificant global shifts, including how we work. The world will always \r\nrequire on-site workers, but if you favour remote work, there are more \r\npossibilities than ever. Here are some of the finest work-from-home \r\nopportunities accessible right now.</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></span></h2>\r\n<ul><li>Work-from-home positions can be full-time or part-time, and you can choose to work for a company or as a contractor.</li><li>Many work-from-home positions demand specialised schooling, but others are available to those with little or no experience.</li></ul><h2><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Customer service representative</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>You will assist customers and solve their issues as a customer \r\nsupport representative. That can be a huge plus or a significant \r\ndisadvantage, based on whether you appreciate working with people, even \r\nas a remote worker. However, it can be a wonderful method for extroverts\r\n to check that item while avoiding the hassles of commuting to work.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the business, you may have little freedom in selecting \r\nyour shifts. Because nearly all companies require customer service \r\nrepresentatives, it may be simpler to locate a firm with which you \r\nidentify. You could work in a remote contact centre or provide chat \r\nassistance.</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Graphic design</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>If you are the type who is constantly scribbling, becoming a graphic \r\ndesigner can be a fantastic way to make money while also giving a \r\ncreative outlet. Graphic designers can work for businesses online or as \r\nfreelancers.</p>\r\n<p>Companies may have more stringent criteria, such as an art degree, \r\nbut as a contractor, you can easily get started with your resume to show\r\n potential customers. However, as a freelancer, you will almost always \r\nneed to purchase your tools and painting materials, which can be costly.</p>\r\n<p>Working as a graphic designer from home enables you to take on new \r\ntasks that you might not have done otherwise, such as creating \r\nslideshows, experimenting with new material kinds and programmes, or \r\nbringing a customer\'s company to life with a gleaming new emblem.</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Bookkeeping</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>If you enjoy arranging numbers, working as a work-from-home \r\nbookkeeper can be a great chance. You will assist companies and business\r\n owners make sense of their books so they can submit their taxes, pay \r\ntheir workers, make business choices, and do everything else needed to \r\noperate a profitable business.</p>\r\n<p>If you are advising businesses on their financial position, you will \r\nusually need official instruction, such as a bachelor\'s degree in \r\naccounting. However, for the daily basics of recording accurate data, \r\nyou can get started with little expertise, and some companies even \r\nprovide on-the-job instruction.</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Proofreading</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>Becoming a proof-reader could be a good fit if you are the sort of \r\nindividual who can detect a typo a mile away. It takes a lot of patience\r\n and precision, but if you have those traits, you should have no trouble\r\n finding employment. Many businesses employ proof-readers on a full-time\r\n or freelance basis to ensure that their text is clean and competent.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;However, reviewing and revising are different. Some customers, \r\nespecially smaller businesses, are only sometimes aware of the \r\ndistinction. You may need to be on the lookout for \"scope creep,\" which \r\noccurs when your customers ask you to do work that goes above and beyond\r\n what they are compensating you for. However, it may be worth a shot \r\nbecause it is simple to get started (all you need is a computer and an \r\nonline link).</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Transcription</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>No dearth of automated transcription software programmes is \r\navailable, but some tasks will always require a human touch. Some \r\ncustomers, such as journalists, prefer to have an actual person \r\ntranscribe audio files from conversations to ensure accuracy. If you \r\nknow medical terminology or other special terms, you can charge a higher\r\n rate for transcribing because your ear may be more sensitive to unusual\r\n vocabulary than a robot\'s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Performing as a transcriptionist is one of the most accessible \r\nwork-from-home opportunities. You will need a foot pedal to initiate and\r\n halt audio recordings to get things moving faster. However, because so \r\nmany people can do it, the pay rates are usually relatively low unless \r\nyou have specific training, such as in medical transcribing.</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Social media management</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>Social media is now essential to how businesses communicate with \r\ntheir consumers. As a social media manager, you will play a role in \r\nforging that relationship. Depending on the industry, this could mean \r\nyou have a lot of freedom in doing things — but you also need to be \r\ncautious not to humiliate your boss.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, social media administrators are only sometimes \r\ncompensated in line with their actual value in terms of business profit.\r\n Because so many individuals can provide this service, pay rates are \r\nonly occasionally the finest. Furthermore, because the social media \r\nenvironment constantly shifts, you will always need to learn new things.</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Programmer</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>\"Programming\" is a broad word that typically refers to anyone who \r\nworks with computer code, including computer programmers, web \r\ndevelopers, software developers, and software engineers.
